# TinyApp

An URL shortener that allows users to store shortened URLs and see the number of visits each of them received.<br/>
It was built using EJS and Express.js

## Shrink that URL!

1. Before you start, run `npm install` to make sure you have all the dependencies.<br/>
2. Make sure nothing is running on `localhost:3000`.<br/>
3. To start the app, run `npm start` within the TinyApp folder. Once the server is up and running, a message `TinyApp listening on port 3000!` will be shown on your commandline interface.<br/>
4. Now you can navigate to `localhost:3000`, create an account and shrink away!<br/>

## Accessing websites through shortened URL's

All of your shrunk URL's will be accessible in My Links. In order to access your saved websites through shortened URL's, type this in your browser address bar: `localhost:3000/u/your-6-character-shortURL`. This feature will be improved. Updates to come.
