# TinyApp

An URL shortener that allows users to store shortened URLs and see the number of visits each of them received.<br/>
It was built using EJS and Express.js

## Shrink that URL!

1. To start the app, run `npm start` within the TinyApp folder.<br/>
2. Make sure nothing is running on your `localhost:3000`. Once the server is up and running, a message `TinyApp listening on port 3000!` will be shown on your commandline interface.<br/>
3. Now you can create an account and shrink away!<br/>

## Accessing websites through shortened URL's

In order to access your saved websites through shortened URL's, type this in your browser address bar: `localhost:3000/u/your-6-character-shortURL`. This feature will be improved. Updates to come.
