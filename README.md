# TinyApp

An URL shortener that allows users to store shortened URLs and see the number of visits each of them received.<br/>
It was built using EJS and Express.js

## Shrink that URL!

1. Before you start, run `npm install` to make sure you have all the dependencies.<br/>
2. Make sure nothing is running on `localhost:3000`.<br/>
3. To start the app, run `npm start` within the TinyApp folder. Once the server is up and running, a message `TinyApp listening on port 3000!` will be shown on your commandline interface.<br/>
4. Now you can navigate to `localhost:3000`, create an account and shrink away!<br/>

## Accessing websites through shortened URL's

All of your short URL's are available in My Links. To access the sites, copy URLs beginning with "localhost:3000/u/" and paste them in your browser address bar.
